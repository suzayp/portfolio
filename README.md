## Hi! Welcome to my portfolio 👋

I am driven by the pursuit of work that pushes boundaries, empowers individuals, and generates significant positive impact. My approach is rooted in a deep curiosity for problem-solving through a human-centered perspective, coupled with a passion for uncovering transformative insights. I excel in bridging connections across diverse disciplines, from design to engineering, leveraging this ability to drive innovation and collaboration.

I am energized by various interests, including advocating for women's education equality, designing art and employing data visualization for impactful storytelling. Outside of work, I find fulfillment in training for my upcoming half-marathon, exploring the integration of diversity within workplace environments, following the NBA, and delving into thought-provoking reads on Goodreads.

Whether it's deciphering insights from raw data, shaping brand strategy, or dissecting complex problems, I am inherently drawn to the art of storytelling. My skill set enables me to weave narratives that inform, inspire, and drive meaningful change.
